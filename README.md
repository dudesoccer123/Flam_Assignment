## Note on Documentation

The Jupyter notebook (`assignment.ipynb`) contains all code and analysis. However, **The images of handwritten equations that I have included in the notebook may not render properly when viewing the .ipynb file on GitHub**. Please refer to the PDF file for the complete report with all images, code and approach included.


Equation with values filled in: 

\left(t*\cos(0.484353)-e^{0.022099\left|t\right|}\cdot\sin(0.3t)\sin(0.484353)\ +53.548,42+t*\sin(0.484353)+e^{0.022099\left|t\right|}\cdot\sin(0.3t)\cos(0.484353)\right)

estimated values: 

* M: 0.022099
* X: 53.548
* Theta: 0.484353 radian / 27.751 degree.
